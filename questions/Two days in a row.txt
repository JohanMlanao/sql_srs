Find all the customers that came two days in a row :
    - Make a self join (LEFT or INNER JOIN) to retrieve all the possible combinations.
    - Remove lines with the same order_id.
    - Keep only rows where the difference between the dates is equal to 1.
In the end, you should have the following columns : customer_id, first_order, date_first_order, second_order, date_next_order.
