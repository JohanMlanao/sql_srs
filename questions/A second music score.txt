Create a column that displays the second-highest salary per department in the wages table:
    - Use a CTE to find the highest salary per department from wages table.
    - Filter this CTE to exclude the maximum.
    - Keep only the column name, wage, department, max_dpt_wage and second_max_dpt_wage.
