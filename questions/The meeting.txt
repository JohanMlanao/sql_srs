Calculate the time that Benjamin spend with his colleagues during each meeting with the following steps :
    - Create a table with all the possible combinations of people present at the same meeting
    - Keep only records where the first person name is Benjamin
    - Remove lines when Benjamin is in a meeting with himself
Keep 4 columns in the end, as some columns will return the same values.
