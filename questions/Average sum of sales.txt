Use a CTE to retrieve clients whose total purchases is higher than the average purchase totals of other customers:
    - Make a query to get total purchases for each client.
    - Store it in a subquery.
    - From this subquery, make another query to get the average of these purchase totals.
    - Store it in a second subquery.
    - From this second subquery, retrieve clients with their total amount spent and filter on clients whose total is higher than the average calculated on the second subquery.

Rename Sum(amount) by total_sales and sort clients alphabetically.
