Calculate average duration spent with each colleague during meetings :
    - Create a table with all the possible combinations of people present at the same meeting.
    - Keep only records where the first person name is Benjamin.
    - Remove lines when Benjamin is in a meeting with himself.
    - Store it in a subquery.
    - From this subquery, group by colleague to calculate the average duration.
    - Sort alphabetically by colleague.
